			<h1> Who am I? </h1>
		</header>
	<p> My name is Dana and I am a senior here at CU Boulder. My hertiage is Bulgarian and I identify with that nationality more so than an American one but living in the US has definitely impacted my way of growing up and thinking. I love to dance, read, cook and chill. Something interesting about me is that I have a bunny named Monkeyman and I built him a tunnel around my apartment because I love arts and crafts and anything that can be considered an adventure!

	<p> I have no experience in web technologies besides what I have learned in Web last semester. I am eager to learn more so that I understand what I am actually doing and how the system works.
